            "To know what you know and what you do not know, that is true knowledge."
        </h3>
        <p>
            Knowledge means understanding of something such as facts, information, description and skills. 
            It is the source of power to man and this distinguishes him from other creatures of the universe. 
            Though man is physically weaker than many animals, for he cannot see as far as an eagle, nor carry heavy loads as some animals. 
            Nevertheless he is the most powerful creature on earth. 
            This power basically comes to him from knowledge not from physical strength.
             ‘Knowledge is power’ means that a man has education and a complete control on his life by using the strength of knowledge.
